Writing my Notational Velocity folder to a git repo.

Heavily based on:
http://monkinetic.com/2011/02/08/wiring-notational-velocity-to-a-github-wiki.html

But the launchctl approach wasn't working, so I went with cron instead 0,22,30 * * * * perl /Users/fkh/tasktracking/taskstogit 

I also decided that I only want to track my todo list, not all other files.

To run stats:
~/tasktracking/gitstats/gitstats/gitstats ~/Library/Application\ Support/Notational\ Data/ ~/tasktracking/stats/
